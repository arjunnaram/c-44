We can easily choose
a character,
a story line,
give the character some goals,
create few rules which character has to follow,
design for balance,
adaptivity,
feedback etc.
and we will have a game ready.
Every good game has a powerful story behind it.
The story is either explicit
(clearly narrated in the game)
or implicit
(inferred by the player)
